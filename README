group

We had need of a group provider on Ubuntu/Solaris with 
has_feature => manages_members, so inspired by the discussion in 
http://markmail.org/message/5slfffn4nca4crem we wrote a quick provider that
we called gpasswd, which will use gpasswd on Ubuntu but just mucks with the
/etc/group file on solaris.
